{"lyric": "Mirror, Tell me who's the fairest of them all, Even if I become a megalomaniac, Come and stroke my ego, Go, go, go , Let me enter your matrix, Taste your delights, No one can,  dissuade me from it, Go, go, go, I'll do anything to accompany you, I'm really one-track-minded, I'm fine in my bubble, Go, go, go, Everything is beautiful, Everything is rosy, For as long as I need it, Tell me, who's the fairest?Go, go, go, Go, go, go, Mirror, What have you done with my head?, This dishonest transformation, It's not what I asked for,Go, go, go, The buzz is nothing but a fake, I'm no longer in the matrix, There's no longer anyone to talk to about it, Go, go, go, I'll do anything to recover, What I'm currently ruining.Finally I've left my bubble, Go, go, go, Everything is beautiful, Everything is rosy, Before my ego imposes, I'm done with looking at you, Go, go, go, Go, go, go, Go, go, go, Ego Ego, Go, go, go.", "song": "Ego"}
